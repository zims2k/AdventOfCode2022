# AdventOfCode2022
My solutions for AOC2022

## Why was this repository created??
This repo was created because I (1) want to back up by code and (2) to provide you with a possible solution to the AOC 2022 competition.

As soon as I have time, I will focus on solving the provided problems in Java.

## My approaches
My first approach was a really focused on object orientation approach. This had a few drawbacks. One of them was that I created an object model in part 1 of a day that was not well suited for part 2 of the day.

## My future approaches
I will now more focus on the tasks and algorithms I have to use and less than on being able to develop a wizard-able program for nothing.

Heading to new directions and solving problems ;) Happy advent (of code) to all of you!!
